Every single Pi I have ever setup has been a headless machine so you don&rsquo;t need the bloat of the desktop environment. <a href=\"https://etcher.io/\">Etcher</a> is a great tool for flashing the downloaded image to your SD card. Whilst you have the SD card in your computer, create a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/\">blank file</a> called <code>ssh</code> in the <code>boot</code> directory to enable <code>ssh</code> and consider adding <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md\">wireless network information</a> if your Pi will be using WiFi.</p>\n<h3>Set a Fixed IP</h3>\n<p>A fixed IP will make it easier to reliably <code>ssh</code> into the machine and browse to any services it may be running. I always set a static IP via my router. I find this a little quicker and simpler to do than on the Raspberry Pi itself and it makes the Pi more portable should I ever change my network, or take it elsewhere. Your router documentation should be able to guide you through the process.</p>\n<h3>Login and Update</h3>\n<pre>ssh pi@192.168.1.10</pre>\n<p>Once you have set your static IP you can login via terminal with the <code>pi</code> username and the default password of <code>raspberry</code>. You can then update the default software stack using:</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get upgrade</pre>\n<h3>Raspi Config</h3>\n<p>This little utility will do a number of things. It will expand the file system, giving you access to the entire SD card, set a memorable hostname and lower the GPU memory to minimum (16mb). With the Pi running headless you shouldn&rsquo;t really need any graphics memory and this gives you the maximum amount of RAM for your projects and code. Run the utility with <code>raspi-config</code>, key around to change the above settings. Once that is done you will need to reboot and login again.</p>\n<p>After rebooting it is worth checking your time and timezone with <code>dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</code>. It has a similar interface to <code>raspi-config</code> and should be easy to find your way around with the keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Add a New User</h3>\n<p>It is a good idea to create your own user account and trash the original pi user. This will keep your Pi nice and safe should you expose it to the Internet or invite a hacker to stay in your house. Run the following commands in sequence replacing <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> with your chosen username.</p>\n<pre>sudo useradd -m &lt;name&gt; -G sudo\r\nsudo passwd &lt;name&gt;\r\nexit\r\nssh &lt;name&gt;@192.168.1.10\r\nsudo adduser &lt;name&gt; video\r\nsudo deluser -remove-home pi</pre>\n<p>These steps will:</p>\n<ul><li>Create you new user and add it to the <code>sudo</code> group</li>\n<li>Setup your password for your new user</li>\n<li>Logout</li>\n<li>Log back in again (remember to change the IP to that of your Pi)</li>\n<li>Add your new user to the video group which fixes a few Raspberry Pi tools like checking CPU temp</li>\n<li>Delete the original pi user and all files in the home directory (make sure you have backed up what you need there first)</li>\n</ul><p>If you find you are unable to autocomplete (tab) commands in your terminal with your new user it may be because you are using the wrong shell. You can fix this <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/a/99791\">following the guide here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Install Git</h3>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install git-core</pre>\n<p>I try to store most of my project code on <a href=\"https://github.com/scottsweb\">GitHub</a> if possible and the git-core package will make it possible to push and pull code from the command line. Whilst you are messing around with Git I recommend taking a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/azlux/log2ram%EF%BF%BD\">log2ram project</a>. It will store all of your system logs in RAM which is useful for reducing SD card wear and prolonging the life of the card. I don&rsquo;t use it on all my Pi projects but it can be useful on busy systems where you have some RAM to spare.</p>\n<h3>Speed Tweaks</h3>\n<p>As well as the usual <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md\">processor overclocking</a> that you <em>can</em> do (I haven&rsquo;t felt the need yet), you can also improve the performance of the SD card. To do so edit <code>boot/config.txt</code> and add <code>dtoverlay=sdhost,overclock_50=100</code> on a new line in the file. The overclock value will need to be adjusted to suit the SD card you are using. It is a fairly <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/how-overclock-microsd-card-reader-on-raspberry-pi-3\">involved process</a> to get the best value for your card but can make a real difference. <code>dmesg</code> is also useful for spotting issues. You should note that this change can cause issues with WiFi too if you are relying on that for your network connection.</p>\n<h3>Power Tweaks</h3>\n<p>One of my favourite things about Raspberry Pis is how power efficient they are. It means you can leave them all the time without worrying about the environmental impact or huge energy bills. With a few additional tweaks you can save a few more milliamps. There are some great tips come from&nbsp;Jeff Geerling in these <a href=\"http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy%EF%BF%BD\">excellent</a> <a href=\"http://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/controlling-pwr-act-leds-raspberry-pi%EF%BF%BD\">posts</a> that are worth running through. My favourite tweak is disabling the HDMI circuitry by adding <code>/usr/bin/tvservice -o</code> to <code>/etc/rc.local</code>.</p>\n<h3>Docker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> is a containerisation software that allows you to isolate software applications. Containers are more lightweight than traditional virtual machines. I find Docker the best way to run services on the Raspberry Pi, it allows me to get the most out of the resources available and removes the need to for reformat the SD card every time my tinkering goes a bit too far. Install docker with the following command and then add your user to the docker group:</p>\n<pre>curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh\r\nsudo usermod -aG docker &lt;name&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Once again replace <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> with your chosen username. I recommend installing docker compose too. This will allow you to configure and start you containers reliably from <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">docker-compose.yml</code> config files.</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install python-pip\r\nsudo pip install docker-compose\r\n</pre>\n<p>This last Docker trick is optional. Docker can use quite a bit of space on your SD card so if you have external storage (like a hard drive) it can sometimes be beneficial to move <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24309526/how-to-change-the-docker-image-installation-directory\">dockers internals to a different storage location</a>. Edit the docker.service file (<code>sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/docker.service</code>) and modify the line starting with <code>ExecStart</code> to be:</p>\n<pre>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -g /path/to/external/storage/\r\n</pre>\n<p>The path should be to your external storage. You can then restart Docker and check the change has saved by running:</p>\n<pre>sudo systemctl daemon-reload\r\nsudo systemctl restart docker\r\ndocker info | grep \"loop file\\|Dir\"\r\n</pre>\n<p>Updating Docker in future may require you to make this change again. You will know if it needs doing as your containers and images will disappear after an update.</p>\n<h3>SSH</h3>\n<p>Almost done. These next few steps will configure SSH, allow for a simpler login (SSH via public key) and mount an external server using <code>sshfs</code>. First generate some keys with <code>ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa</code> and add public keys from your other computers to: <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. <code>sshfs</code> should be installed with <code>sudo apt-get install sshfs</code>. Once installed you can mount your external server by editing <code>/etc/fstab</code> and adding:</p>\n<pre>&lt;name&gt;@192.168.1.11:/media/data/ /media/path/ fuse.sshfs _netdev,nonempty,allow_other,IdentityFile=/home/&lt;name&gt;/.ssh/id_rsa,reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=45,ServerAliveCountMax=2 0 0\r\n</pre>\n<p>Make sure you set the relevant paths, IP addresses and usernames in the fstab entry above. Test it <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/questions/174181/how-do-you-validate-fstab-without-rebooting\">without a reboot</a> by typing <code>sudo mount -a</code>.</p>\n<p>With all that completed you are now set with the perfect slice of Pi. Time to get hacking on your projects!</p>\n<h3>Optional Extras</h3>\n<ul><li>Tweak <a href=\"https://www.bitpi.co/2015/02/11/how-to-change-raspberry-pis-swapfile-size-on-rasbian/%EF%BF%BD\">your swap</a> if RAM is tight (works well with <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3/\">compute modules</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/02/long-overdue-introduction-ecryptfs.html\">Encrypt your home folder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://longsteve.com/wiki/index.php?title=USB_Hard_Drive_Encryption_on_a_Raspberry_Pi\">Encrypt an external drive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\">Mount a samba/Windows share</a></li>\n<li>Adjust the <a href=\"http://www.embeddedpi.com/documentation/installing-linux-os/cm3-speed-thermal-os-configuration-options%EF%BF%BD\">thermal properties of the CPU</a></li>\n</ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"In my next few posts I will be writing about my home automation setup which is based around a handful of Raspberry Pis.

Nuxt is a framework for creating Universal <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a> Applications and in many ways it feels like working on a WordPress theme. It has a folder for your pages/templates, a hook API, support for plugins and components (or template parts if your thinking WordPress). Nuxt follows a philosophy of convention over configuration, drop Vue components in their respective folders and Nuxt will bind everything together.</p>\n<p>This fairly rigid structure is important to the framework as it allows it to operate in three distinct modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Single page application (SPA) &ndash; Run as a regular Vue web app</li>\n<li>Server Side Rendered (SSR) &ndash; For each request, pre-render the application in a server and send that back to the client</li>\n<li>Static (Generated) &ndash; Pre-render the application once during build, and then serve it as an SPA</li>\n</ul><p>I was personally interested in the static (generated) and SPA modes which would allow me to host the interface in isolation to WordPress and without the need for Node.js hosting. This would allow me to make use of some of the free static hosting options out there like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">GitHub pages</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?http://surge.sh/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">surge.sh</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box Nuxt supports routing (<a href=\"https://router.vuejs.org/\">vue router</a>), a store (<a href=\"https://vuex.vuejs.org/\">vuex</a>), filters (core vue 2) and meta data (<a href=\"https://github.com/declandewet/vue-meta\">vue-meta</a>). I added some additional plugins for progressive web app (<a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt-community/pwa-module\">PWA</a>) features, <a href=\"http://velocityjs.org/\">animation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload\">lazy loading</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Vivify-Ideas/vue-shortcuts\">keyboard navigation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt-community/sitemap-module\">sitemap</a> generation and API consumption with <a href=\"https://axios.nuxtjs.org/\">axios</a>.</p>\n<p>After some experimentation I discovered that Nuxt didn&rsquo;t quite work as I expected to. A statically generated version of the site only loads statically for the initial page load, the app is then bootstrapped and runs client side, making API requests back to the WordPress API. This is probably fine in most circumstances but I wanted to have a version of the site served over <a href=\"https://datproject.org/\">Dat</a> (the <a href=\"https://beakerbrowser.com/\">peer to peer web</a>) and would rather that it didn&rsquo;t need the API. I was looking for a truly static site.</p>\n<p>Luckily Nuxt has some hooks which allowed me to cache a local copy of the API responses as JSON during the build process. When deployed, the app will then query itself rather than the WordPress API. You can see some of the logic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/modules/generate.js\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/plugins/axios.js\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>WordPress</h3>\n<p>The WordPress side didn&rsquo;t need a great deal of tinkering. I moved the site to <a href=\"https://api.scott.ee\">api.scott.ee</a> and set a redirect on that to the main site. I then introduced a couple of filters for supporting lazy loaded images and enabled <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/image-cdn/\">photon in Jetpack</a> so images are served from a CDN. Images are the only thing that are not part of the generated build of the site.</p>\n<p>WordPress should see very little traffic (if any) and only ever be hit when I want to write some new content or during the site build/generate process when the API is fetched and cached.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Nuxt takes care of a great deal of the app bundling, minification and optimisation for you. Add the PWA module and you can get a decent <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\">Lighthouse</a> score right out the box. I also recommend installing the <a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt-community/webpackmonitor-module\">Nuxt webpack monitor module</a> which allows you to inspect the size of your bundles which can be useful when you start to make use of third party add ons. Running <code>yarn nuxt build --webpackmonitor --analyze</code> will launch an interactive breakdown of how your site is put together.</p>\n<p>The next thing to implement was lazy loading. Lazy loading ensures that images are not wasting bandwidth by loading unnecessarily. Using Jetpack&rsquo;s photon CDN I can request a much smaller version of the original image to act as a loading image while the original, full size image, is fetched. I use CSS filters to blur the loading image slightly and make it greyscale. The result is rather neat:</p>\n<p><noscript><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1597\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-hampshire-river.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Image of river in Hampshire, England.

In <a href=\"https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/plugins/lazyload.js#L18-L40\">these scenarios</a> the image quality is reduced to 50% and the resolution divided by four.</p>\n<p>As you page around the site a request for the next page is made in the background of the current page to help speed things up too.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>I had grand plans for this. My aim was to use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/\">Cloudflare&rsquo;s load balancing</a> feature to split the site hosting between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://www.netlify.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">Netlify</a>&nbsp;and GitHub pages. That way if either service went down, the site would stay up. Cloudflare would also act as a third backup / cache if things got really messy. I struggled to get the load balancing health checks to work and the load balancing feature came in at a whopping cost of $5 a month so I decided to park that idea for now.</p>\n<p>After some speed testing I decided to keep things simple. It turns out that GitHub pages are one of the fastest places to put your code and Cloudfare only seemed to make it slower (albeit just a little bit):</p>\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>netlify: sweden (no cloudflare)\r\n\r\nFirst test: 2.04s 88/100\r\nSecond test: 1.79s 88/100\r\nThird test: 1.69s 88/100\r\n\r\nnetlify: sweden (cloudflare)\r\n\r\nFirst test: 3.17s 94/100\r\nSecond test: 2.20s 94/100\r\nThird test: 3.17s 94/100\r\n\r\ngithub: sweden (no cloudflare)\r\n\r\nFirst test: 540ms 88/100\r\nSecond test: 200ms 88/100\r\nThird test: 236ms 88/100\r\n\r\ngithub: sweden (cloudflare)\r\n\r\nFirst test: 786ms 94/100\r\nSecond test: 312ms 94/100\r\nThird test: 277ms 94/100</code></pre>\n<h3>Dat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://href.li/?https://datproject.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">Dat</a>&nbsp;describes itself as:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A p2p hypermedia protocol. It provides public-key-addressed file archives which can be synced securely and browsed on-demand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In short, you can host your website using peer to peer technology and it is super exciting. Everyone that visits a site is also potentially a host of the site.</p>\n<p>In order to visit the Dat version of my site you can use the <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://beakerbrowser.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">Beaker</a> browser. Using Dat DNS allows the site to be found at: <a href=\"dat://scott.ee/\">dat://scott.ee/</a>. There is currently one mirror/peer that is always online at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://hashbase.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">hashbase.io</a>&nbsp;and one of my next projects will be to set a Raspberry Pi to the task of providing another mirror. I would love to see some other mirrors pop up too if you feel like adding it to your library.</p>\n<p>Using Nuxt to statically generate the site makes pushing to Dat a much simpler task, I am not really sure how WordPress will adapt to the peer to peer web as things currently stand.</p>\n<h3>The Results</h3>\n<p>So how did I do with my goals?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Learn</strong>. I work with React most days so I wanted to try something else to better understand modern web development, not just a particular framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Completed. I am fairly comfortable with the basics of Vue now and learnt a great deal about Nuxt as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Speed</strong>. I wanted a site that is extremely fast, lightweight and better for the planet</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pretty good, the load time hovers around 300ms and the page size at around 130kb without images. The lighthouse scores are fairly decent too with the lowest score being 73 for progressive web app features (this is mostly because I have disabled the service worker while I get up to speed with how they work).</p>\n<p>It turns out that a friend and colleague at work has also been experimenting with making WordPress more planet friendly at the same time. I highly recommend taking a read of his post on serving <a href=\"https://blog.jacklenox.com/2018/06/04/delivering-wordpress-in-7kb/\">WordPress in just 7kb</a>! quite the achievement and it shows there is probably a great deal room for improvement here.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"></figure><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Resilient</strong>. A site can handle LOTS of traffic and to be redundant via the peer to peer web</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moderate. Without the load balancing there is a single point of failure. Having the Dat version ticks the box for the P2P web although I would like to consider seeding the site on other protocols as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Low cost</strong>. Less than &pound;15 a month to host and maintain</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complete. Cost is &pound;0.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Privacy built in</strong>. No trackers, externally hosted JavaScript or fonts</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complete. No need for GDPR compliance&nbsp;&#128578;</p>\n<h3>What Next?</h3>\n<p>The site isn&rsquo;t much to look at right now, I treated this a purely a technical exercise rather than a design one but it provides the foundations for something much more interesting. My plans include:</p>\n<ul><li>Gutenberg support</li>\n<li>Sustainable hosting. Performance is one part of the battle</li>\n<li>Store preservation between sessions which may be a better approach than the locally cached API during build</li>\n<li>Service worker support. I would like to get the Lighthouse score to 100 and find some other performance gains</li>\n<li>An automated build and deploy script that only builds the difference in content</li>\n</ul><p>If you are interested in the code you can find it here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer\">github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee</a>.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"If you have ever visited this site before you may have noticed a few changes over the last week.

href=\"https://stayandroam.blog/snaps-from-berlin/\">Gemma</a> and I took a short trip to Berlin. It is a place we have always wanted to visit and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint. It is a city full of history, interesting architecture and most importantly, great food!</p>\n<p>Walking back to our hotel one evening, we discovered a building that stood out to us. It was a huge, abandoned and had &lsquo;Stop Wars&rsquo; painted in red across the front. The lettering was the height of two floors and spanned the width of one end of the building. A fairly impressive piece of graffiti on an even more impressive building.</p>\n<p>It seemed odd that such a huge structure had been left to decay in what is a fairly central and busy part of the city. If this was London, it would be have been re-developed into flats and restaurants long ago.</p>\n<p>We got a little closer and made our way into the central courtyard to see if we could find a way to photograph or see inside. We took a few steps into the courtyard and realised we were already being followed. Not knowing the area we scuttled back the main road and continued to walk along the entire length of the building, it went on forever.</p>\n<p>Back at the hotel and on a stable Internet connection, we started researching this mysterious, bleak and intriguing lump of concrete. It turns out we had discovered Haus der Statistik, the former statistics-gathering HQ of the German Democratic Republic. The top search result was a blog called <a href=\"http://www.abandonedberlin.com/2011/01/stalking-stasi-in-haus-der-statistik_6120.html\">Abandoned Berlin</a>. It is a fascinating site that explores the history of forgotten landmarks in and around Berlin. It has some beautiful photos of these forgotten buildings &mdash; including photos inside of Haus der Statistik that we didn&rsquo;t manage to snap ourselves:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1484\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><noscript><img class=\"wp-image-1484 size-full\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dark room with table, chair and computer screens.\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=700%2C467&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=120%2C80&amp;ssl=1 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></noscript><div class=\"lazy\"><img class=\"wp-image-1484 size-full\" src=\"\" alt=\"Dark room with table, chair and computer screens.\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=250%2C167&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=700%2C467&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/haus-der-statistik-inside.jpg?resize=120%2C80&amp;ssl=1 120w\"></div><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inside Haus der Statistik &ndash; photo from <a href=\"http://www.abandonedberlin.com/2011/01/stalking-stasi-in-haus-der-statistik_6120.html\">Abandoned Berlin</a></p></div>\n<p>Haus der Statistik finished construction in 1970 and the top three floors were allocated for use by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi\">Stasi</a>. When unified Germany took over the building, the Stasi archives were made available to the German people. It would have been interesting to see what information may have been gathered about you by people never met. The archives were all moved out of the building in 1995 and the building was eventually abandoned in 2008. Looking at historical photos it is fascinating to see how the building changes and responds to the environment around it. Now it sits empty and is rather beautiful in a strange sort of way.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we discovered the Abandoned Berlin site just a little too late into our trip which meant we didn&rsquo;t get to investigate more of the places that Ciaran has written about. Gemma surprised me with the <a href=\"http://shop.abandonedberlin.com/product/verlassene-orte-abandoned-berlin\">Abandoned Berlin book</a> for my birthday (who says blogging doesn&rsquo;t pay?!) and I have since been browsing through more of these fascinating landmarks and stories.</p>\n<p>Reading through the book it got me thinking about the things we build and leave behind. In the digital space there is no real concept of decay, change or imperfection. Everything is binary, it either exists or it doesn&rsquo;t. We have very little interest in preserving the things we make and all too often they simply disappear.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of the Japense saying &lsquo;Wabi-Sabi&rsquo; which roughly translates to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">&hellip;the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete.</p>\n<p>&ndash; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi\">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>There are very few objects in life that become more beautiful as they wear and age. From time to time you will find something and I like to think Haus der Statistik is one of them. I have yet to find anything digital that displays these same unique qualities. I&rsquo;d like to find it. I would like to leave behind something that lasts.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Earlier this year my wife Gemma and I took a short trip to Berlin.

On a Sunday afternoon when the weather is bad I like nothing more than to sit down to an episode of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo\">Columbo</a>. My wife and I have the entire box set and have made our way though every episode, including the pilots of Mrs Columbo. Watching a random episode is now just an: &ldquo;Alexa, ask Plex to play Columbo&rdquo; away. Bliss.</p>\n<p>Today is no exception and watching the way he interrogates, questions and learns had me realise that there is a great deal a designer can learn from this unassuming TV detective.</p>\n<h3>Ask the right question at the right time</h3>\n<p>Columbo is famous for his catchphrase &ldquo;Just one more thing&hellip;&rdquo;, which is his way of squeezing in one last question before he leaves. As a detective he thrives on data and knows the right questions to ask and when to ask them.</p>\n<p>This week I have been gathering plugin data across our VIP Go platform and using it to better understand how clients are using plugins on our platform. My aim is to reduce the number of options available for managing plugins and for us to provide a better service when it comes to updates and security fixes. The question I am asking myself right now is: what plugins are in use and how have they been activated?</p>\n<p>We will start collecting the data and graphing it over time so we can actively monitor the progress of my work from start to finish. I can see the same data being hugely useful as time goes on. We just haven&rsquo;t found the need to ask the next question yet.</p>\n<h3>Put yourself in your <del>killers</del> clients shoes</h3>\n<p>In &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069901/\">Any Old Port in a Storm</a>&rdquo; the murder takes places in a winery. The murderer is a wine connoisseur and in order to understand how the killing took place Columbo immerses himself in the world of wine. The knowledge he gains from his research allows him to solve the case and determine where the body was stored. The research also created a huge amount of empathy between Columbo and the killer.</p>\n<p>With the launch of the <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/\">new VIP website</a> a few weeks ago it has been a great reminder of the challenges our clients face when they need to push code from a modern version control environment like GitHub to our SVN setup on WordPress.com. Putting ourselves through the same experience as our clients has been immensely valuable and highlighted some of the pain points developers face with our WordPress.com platform. We are hoping to use our new found empathy to help streamline the process if possible.</p>\n<h3>Equipment doesn&rsquo;t have to be the best</h3>\n<p>Rust bucket doesn&rsquo;t quite describe the poor state of Columbo&rsquo;s car. He arrives on scene in a puff of smoke in a old French car that looks like it could barely take a corner without rattling to bits. The car serves him well across the entire 32 year lifespan of the programme. It gets him where needs to go and does the job well enough.</p>\n<p>We are very privileged at Automattic to receive a new computer every 18 months and have access to the very latest and greatest technology. The problem with this is our tools do not necessarily reflect those of the people we serve. This is one of the reasons I moved away from an Apple laptop this year.</p>\n<p>The more we can diversify the technology we use, the greater it represents the audience we serve and the better our products will be as a result.</p>\n<h3>Name for SEO</h3>\n<p>When Columbo adopts a dog in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068398/\">&Eacute;tude in Black</a>&rdquo; he spends most of the episode trying to decide a name for his new pet. He settled on &ldquo;Dog&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The names we use for projects, software and teams are hugely important for discoverability, especially when most of us begin exploring cyberspace with a search.</p>\n<h3>And one last thing&hellip;</h3>\n<p>If you are feeling inspired to sit down with Columbo for an hour or two then I recommend the following episodes:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069903/\">Double Exposure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068395/\">Blueprint for Murder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075864/\">The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case</a></li>\n</ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"I have a guilty pleasure.

It is an impressive bit of kit. Small, light, well built and very comfortable to use. There are some really nice little touches. For example there is an option in the BIOS to turn it into a battery pack for other USB devices and I really appreciated that the laptop shipped in packaging that is almost completely recyclable.</p>\n<p>My main complaint would be the placement of the webcam which sits just above the keyboard and makes for some interesting perspectives on video calls. The webcam placement though allows for an almost borderless display which is probably one of the nicest parts of the laptop. In short, it is a compromise worth making.</p>\n<p>I have improved the webcam problem by bringing the laptop off of the desk on a <a href=\"https://www.therooststand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Roost stand</a>. The stand is portable too so I intend to take it with me when travelling.</p>\n<p>I have been impressed at how well devices have worked with this laptop. For instance I can easily switch between HDMI audio, internal audio and headphones. This all works far better than it ever did on my Mac.</p>\n<h3>The OS</h3>\n<p><noscript><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-239\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/scottsweb.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/screenshot-from-2017-03-31-14-34-23.png?resize=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot of a customised Ubuntu install that is running the Cinnamon desktop.

I have never been a fan of the default Ubuntu desktop environment (<a href=\"https://unity.ubuntu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Unity</a>) so began testing different distributions straight away. My preference was to stay with something Ubuntu/Debian based as this is where I have the most Linux experience thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi</a> and a <a href=\"https://m.do.co/c/d087b77a9e9b\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Ocean droplet</a> I host with. I tested <a href=\"https://linuxmint.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mint</a>, <a href=\"https://elementary.io\" target=\"_blank\">Elementary</a>, <a href=\"https://ubuntugnome.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu Gnome</a>, <a href=\"https://ubuntu-mate.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu Mate</a> and <a href=\"https://xubuntu.org\" target=\"_blank\">Xubuntu</a>. There were quirks with every single one, mostly around the HiDPI screen and occasionally odd bits of hardware too. Out of them all I was hoping for Elementary to work the best. Unfortunately it failed to detect both the WiFi and correctly support the HiDPI screen.</p>\n<p>In the end I switched back to Ubuntu, upgraded to 16.10 and installed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(software)\" target=\"_blank\">Cinnamon desktop environment</a> which is part of the Mint distribution. I took to Mint very quickly and it allowed me to create a desktop experience similar to the one I had on my Mac. When logging into Ubuntu I can pick Cinnamon as the default and I have yet to feel the need go back to Unity. As Cinnamon is built for Mint there are a few small bugs from time to time but I have managed to work past most of them.</p>\n<p>Most of the quirks seem to be around the HiDPI screen. Switching between my standard DPI desktop screen and the laptop screen requires me to restart Cinnamon sometimes and I have found it almost impossible to run both the laptop screen at desktop screen at the same time with different DPI settings. To be fair though, most of the distributions I tested struggled with this too.</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>From a development perspective Linux is fantastic. I would say my experience with the tools has been better than those on Mac. I have mostly all the same applications I have come to rely on and there has been almost no disruption in my workflows. The <a href=\"https://atom.io\" target=\"_blank\">Atom editor</a> has played a major part in easing the transition which allowed me to keep all my favourite extensions and settings.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>This has been much trickier. I was hoping I could keep Adobe Photoshop and launch it under <a href=\"https://www.winehq.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wine</a>. I managed to get a 2014 version of Photoshop installed and running but failed when it came to Illustrator. Some of the open source alternatives are OK <strong>&mdash;</strong> <a href=\"https://inkscape.org\" target=\"_blank\">Inkscape</a> seems to be heading in the right direction, but to collaborate with others I really need to able to at least open some Adobe file formats.</p>\n<p>My solution has been to install Windows 10 as a virtual machine. I tested a few different ways of running a virtual machine and settled with <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org\" target=\"_blank\">VirtualBox</a> as it allowed me to enable 3D support in the box. From the VM I run Creative Suite and <a href=\"https://www.sketchup.com\" target=\"_blank\">SketchUp</a>, although I have SketchUp installed under Wine as well.

For my birthday friends and family clubbed together to purchase a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12&Prime; Powerbook G4</a>. It was a stunning little machine made from aluminium that was both perfectly portable and powerful. It was rather different from the LED lit, transparent cased, custom PCs I was using and building at the time.</p>\n<p>OSX took some time to get used to; having grown up with DOS and Windows machines it was a relatively jarring experience but a mostly welcome one too. I took great delight in finding alternatives for my favourite Windows applications. The only application I really missed was Winamp (iTunes has always been sub-optimal).</p>\n<p>Over time, I grew to really love the world of Apple to the point I would eagerly await the keynotes of Steve Jobs. I have owned a handful of Apple laptops, two iPods, two iPhones and an iPad in the years since that birthday.</p>\n<h3>Feeling Pressed</h3>\n<p>Every eighteen months <a href=\"https://automattic.com\">Automattic</a> employees are encouraged to upgrade their primary work machines. Like many, I was waiting for the new line of Macbooks. I waited, then waited some more. When it came to the launch day I was already having my doubts as to if I would order another Apple product. This is what I have been thinking:</p>\n<h3>Open Source</h3>\n<p>Working for a company that builds and promotes the use of Open Source, I find it strange that so many of us use a proprietary operating systems and software. If I had to guess I would say 90% of the company is using Apple products, all day, everyday. How can we build software for everyone when so few of us are testing our products on other hardware and software?</p>\n<p>Despite our Apple lacuna (a nicer way of saying blind spot, thanks <a href=\"http://johnmaeda.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John</a>), Automattic is a very supportive company. I will be supported in my decision to move away from Apple. In fact I see this as the perfect opportunity to try something new.</p>\n<h3>Price</h3>\n<p>The UK has not yet left the European Union. Our politicians are a disorganised bunch of idiots. It is going to take them some time to even agree on the process that we need in order to begin leaving. People estimate two years. I give it six. With any luck it might never happen.</p>\n<p>Apple couldn&rsquo;t wait six months before announcing a Brexit inspired price hike. A top spec 15&Prime; Macbook pro will now cost around &pound;5,000. Add dongles and you are beyond the point of ridiculous. The laptop I would have ordered would have been just shy of &pound;3,000 and I would have liked to have added another hundred pounds worth of dongles in order to use my existing hardware.</p>\n<p>It seems crazy to me in a World where hardware continues to get cheaper and a Raspberry Pi costs &pound;5. Why should an Apple machine cost as much as a second hand car?</p>\n<h3>Old Hardware, Dongles and Touch Bar</h3>\n<p>Having splashed out all that money you would expect your Macbook to be running the latest hardware. Well they are not. The processors are not the latest from Intel.</p>\n<p>Perhaps then you might expect that your new laptop would come with an extension lead for charging (as all previous Apple laptops have). Nope.</p>\n<p>You should also know that they took away the glowing Apple and stickers too.</p>\n<p>And then there is the dongle situation. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopSci/status/830937062484406273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I am sure you have heard about it by now</a>. A free dongle would be nice, just one would be a big help.</p>\n<p>What that leaves you with is the touch bar. The little battery hog that requires two interactions for what used to take one. I am sure it will be useful for something, eventually.</p>\n<h3>OSX</h3>\n<p>iOS devices have become Apples primary focus, they sell extremely well and have been the driving force for changes to OSX. As iOS evolves, OSX evolves to be closer to it. This results in a restrictive environment where flexibility is traded for security. For example, installing third-party software is becoming harder and operating system changes are reset after a reboot.</p>\n<p>I like to tinker and that right is being taken from me. I feel more and more like a second class citizen on hardware the I own and operate.</p>\n<p>I am also not a fan of any of the default Apple software. I don&rsquo;t use iTunes, Maps, Mail, Pages, Numbers, Safari, GarageBand, Contacts, Calendar, Photos, Messenger, FaceTime or Chess. If I could, I would uninstall them all.</p>\n<h3>So&hellip;</h3>\n<p>So today I took delivery of my new laptop. A <a href=\"https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/01/dell-xps-13-ubuntu-review-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell XPS 13 developer edition</a> that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu. In many ways I feel as I did back when I got my Powerbook; excited and anxious for the change. I need to find new software, create new habits and work out which distro and desktop environment best fits my needs.</p>\n<p>The time for Open Source software is now.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Twelve years ago I got my first Apple computer.

At the touch of a button it allows you to view your site at a range of popular device widths (iPhone, tablet etc). What is particularly handy is that your browser stays at full width so your developer tools stay nice and large, making styles and scripts easier to debug.</p>\n<p>On a recent client site we felt it would be useful for content editors to easily preview their content at different device widths. These editors didn&rsquo;t have access to theme WordPress customiser so we looked at providing them access to the viewport resizer bookmarklet via the admin bar. Responsible was born.</p>\n<p>Responsible has one filter that allows you register a customised bookmarklet.</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">add_filter('responsible_bookmarklet', 'custom_bookmarklet');\r\nfunction custom_bookmarklet() {\r\n    return '';  // add your generated bookmarklet here\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can generate your own custom bookmarklet to use with the filter on the <a href=\"http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/#customize\">viewport resizer website</a>.</p>\n<p>Contribute to the plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/cftp/responsible\">GitHub</a> or:</p>\n<p><a class=\"abutton btn btn--primary\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsible/\">Download Responsible from WordPress.org</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Responsible adds a responsive button to the WordPress admin bar.
