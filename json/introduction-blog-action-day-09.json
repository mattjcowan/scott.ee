The article, written by <a title=\"Tim Jackson\" href=\"http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/pages/tim-jackson.html\">Tim Jackson</a> sets the tone for our Blog Action Day posts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every society clings to a myth by which it lives. Ours is the myth of economic growth. For the last five decades the pursuit of growth has been the single most important policy goal across the world. The global economy is almost five times the size it was half a century ago. If it continues to grow at the same rate, the economy will be 80 times that size by the year 2010.</p>\n<p>This extraordinary ramping up of the global economy has no historical precedent. It&rsquo;s totally at odds with our scientific knowledge of the finite resource base and the fragile ecology we depend on for survival. And it has already been accompanied by the degradation of an estimated 60% of the world&rsquo;s ecosystems.</p>\n<p>For the most part, we avoid the stark reality of these numbers. The default assumption is that &mdash; financial crisis aside &mdash; growth will continue indefinitely. Not just for the poorest countries where a better quality of life is undeniably needed, but even for the richest nations where the cornucopia of material wealth adds little to happiness and is beginning to threaten the foundations of our well-being.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this collective blindness are easy enough to find. The modern economy is structurally reliant on economic growth for its stability. When growth falters &mdash; as it has done recently &mdash; politicians panic. Businesses struggle to survive. People loose their jobs and sometimes their homes. A spiral of recession looms. Questioning growth is deemed to be the act of lunatics, idealists and revolutionaries.</p>\n<p>But question it we must. The myth of growth has failed us. It has failed the two billion people who still live on less that $2 a day. It has failed the fragile ecological systems we depend on for survival. It has failed spectacularly, in its own terms, to provide economic stability and secure people&rsquo;s livelihoods.</p>\n<p>Today we find ourselves faced with the imminent end of the era of cheap oil; the prospect (beyond the recent bubble) of steadily rising commodity prices; the degradation of forests, lakes and soils; conflicts over land use, water quality and fishing rights; and the momentous challenge of stabilizing concentrations of carbon in the global atmosphere. And we face these tasks with an economy that is fundamentally broken, in desperate need of renewal&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n<p>A message this clear needs little summary. Solving these issues must become our priority.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Today, bloggers across the globe are writing about one topic: climate change.
