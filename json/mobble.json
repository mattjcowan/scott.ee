The idea is that one site (with the help of <a title=\"CSS Media Queries specification\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/\">CSS media queries</a>) can serve a whole range of devices from handheld to desktop. It&rsquo;s great. It saves time, future proofs your website and it&rsquo;s a great approach to modern web design.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries are the three technical ingredients for responsive web design, but it also requires a different way of thinking. Rather than quarantining our content into disparate, device-specific experiences, we can use media queries to progressively enhance our work within different viewing contexts.<br>\n&mdash; <a title=\"Responsive web design\" href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\">Ethan Marcotte</a></p></blockquote>\n<h3>All is Good?</h3>\n<p>We have hit a problem with relying on CSS media queries alone. There are times when not all of the content, JavaScript or CSS on a page is relevant for a particular device and simply hiding the unwanted content with CSS is not ideal. Lets say you&rsquo;re in the countryside with a limited data connection and your trying to find an address for you&rsquo;re next meeting. We should not force you to download unnecessary content and load heavy JavaScript libraries that waste your time and your data allowance. mobble helps address this.</p>\n<h3>mobble</h3>\n<p>Those of you familiar with WordPress will be familiar with <a title=\"Conditional template tags\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags\">conditional functions</a>. mobble is a collection of similar functions that allow you to test for a specific type of mobile or handheld device. We have wrapped these functions into a neat WordPress plugin but you will also be able to use these in other projects too.</p>\n<h4>The Functions</h4>\n<p>The most useful four functions:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">is_handheld(); // any handheld device (phone, tablet, Nintendo)\r\nis_mobile(); // any type of mobile phone (iPhone, Android, etc)\r\nis_tablet(); // any tablet device (currently iPad, Galaxy Tab)\r\nis_ios(); // any Apple device (iPhone, iPad, iPod)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The full list (hopefully self explanatory):</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">is_iphone();\r\nis_ipad();\r\nis_ipod();\r\nis_android();\r\nis_blackberry();\r\nis_opera_mobile();\r\nis_palm();\r\nis_symbian();\r\nis_windows_mobile();\r\nis_motorola();\r\nis_samsung();\r\nis_samsung_tablet();\r\nis_sony_ericsson();\r\nis_nintendo();\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Some Examples</h4>\n<p>In this first example we are loading a specific stylesheet for Apple devices:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">&lt;?php\r\nif (is_ios()) {\r\n    wp_enqueue_style('ios', get_template_directory_uri() . '/ios.css');\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this second example we hide the sidebar from all mobile/phone devices:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">&lt;?php\r\nif (!is_mobile()) {\r\n    get_sidebar();\r\n}\r\n?&gt;</code></pre>\n<h4>An Added Bonus</h4>\n<p>For those of you that run this as a WordPress plugin we have added a nice little feature that adds browser information to the body class of your theme. This allows you to use CSS to tweak your design for certain devices. Look for the mobble settings within the WordPress admin interface, from here you can turn this feature on and off.</p>\n<p>We will do our best to keep the plugin up to date with the latest devices that hit the market and if you have any ideas to make it better please get in touch. A demo is available at: <a title=\"WordPress Plugin Demo Site\" href=\"http://wp.scott.ee\">wp.scott.ee</a>.
