Instead it scrapes the publicly accessible JSON from the Instagram website.</p>\n<p>There is a increasing trend within the world of startups to lock your content away. Twitter taking away RSS is a good example of this and it&rsquo;s not something I agree with. Of course authentication should be required for certain features but making it harder to access my own content is not cool.</p>\n<p>In a short time the plugin has proved rather popular so it looks like folk are quite fond of this simple approach too. The popularity is such that I am considering using the same approach in a few more plugins.</p>\n<p>The widget has two filters. The first allows you adjust that cache time for retrieving the images from Instagram:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">add_filter('null_instagram_cache_time', 'my_cache_time');\r\nfunction my_cache_time() {\r\n    return HOUR_IN_SECONDS;\r\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The second allows you to filter video results from the widget:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">add_filter('wpiw_images_only', '__return_true');</code></pre>\n<p>In version 1.3 I have also added two new hooks for adding custom output before and after the widget:</p>\n<pre><code>wpiw_before_widget\r\nwpiw_after_widget\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can contribute to the plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/cftp/wp-instagram-widget\">GitHub</a> or:</p>\n<p><a class=\"abutton btn btn--primary\" title=\"Download WP Instagram Widget from WordPress.org\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-instagram-widget/\">Download from WordPress.org</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"WP Instagram Widget is a simple plugin for WordPress that makes it easy to showcase your latest Instagram photos and videos on your website.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1179"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=1179"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1179/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=1179"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=1179"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=1179"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"author":[{"id":1,"name":"scottsweb","url":"","description":"","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/author/scottsweb/","slug":"scottsweb","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users"}]}}],"wp:term":[[{"id":11,"link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/category/wordpress/","name":"WordPress","slug":"wordpress","taxonomy":"category","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/11"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/taxonomies/category"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?categories=11"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}],[]]}},{"id":1027,"date":"2013-11-06T21:47:18","date_gmt":"2013-11-06T21:47:18","guid":{"rendered":"http://scott.cloudcontrol.me/?p=1027"},"modified":"2017-12-16T17:42:32","modified_gmt":"2017-12-16T17:42:32","slug":"bomb-garden","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/bomb-garden/","title":{"rendered":"The Bomb In The Garden"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s now or nev&shy;er for the web.

Would it be possible to have separate WordPress installations, discover and share content between each other? If it is possible, would it be useful? and how might it be achieved?</p>\n<p>My idea is to release a WordPress plugin (WP2P) that provides the core functionality for a P2P environment. It will allow other plugins and themes to register their own payloads to be shared on the network. The WP2P core will consist of two key components:</p>\n<h3>The Tracker</h3>\n<p>Most P2P networks seem to require a <a title=\"More than you could ever want to know about BitTorrent Trackers\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker\">tracker</a> to aid with client discovery. The job of the tracker is to be the first port of call for any new client on the network. In a WordPress environment it would keep track of the URLs of WordPress installations already in the swarm and share them with new sites that join the WP2P network.</p>\n<p>Once the tracker has introduced the new client to the pool of clients it takes a back seat and the clients can begin to function independently. A client and tracker may communicate from time to time to ensure the tracker has an up to date list of active WordPress installations in the swarm.</p>\n<p>I see this functionality being built on top of the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API\">XML-RPC API</a> that already exisits in WordPress. This API takes care of remote authentication which would allow for both private and public trackers. Private trackers would require a login to join the swarm, whilst the public trackers (providing you have the tracker URL) would be open to anyone.</p>\n<h3>The Client</h3>\n<p>Once a client has been introduced by the tracker, it would need to ask around for a list of available payloads and clients from each other client in the network. It would most likely use <a title=\"WordPress Cron Functions\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Category:WP-Cron_Functions\">WP-Cron</a> and XML-RPC to make remote requests fairly frequently (I cannot see another way in PHP). This approach should result in clients discovering and sharing data autonomously.</p>\n<p>The site administrator will be able to opt in and out of the available payloads from within the WordPress admin. This will be especially important when using a public tracker for security reason. You would need to be vary cautious about what is downloaded and shared. Keeping this environment secure would have to be very high priority and something to investigate.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s about now that your probably wondering if I have lost my mind and you would be right in asking&hellip; what are we going to use this crazy bit of kit for?</p>\n<h3>Payloads</h3>\n<p>There are some fairly obvious use cases for this technology. Creating a number of website mirrors would be my first thought and sharing media library assets could be very handy too. In fact WordPress already has a rather interesting function that allows side loading media from other locations: <a title=\"WordPres fucntion wp_handle_sideload\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_handle_sideload\">wp_handle_sideload</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond the obvious, here is another powerful idea. Decentralising content. WordPress is developed as a community so perhaps our content can be too?</p>\n<p>Lets say your a DJ in London and you run an events website. It turns out there are already another three websites promoting different DJ events and it would be great if you all got together and shared your events. If your all using WordPress and WP2P, you could automatically share each others events at the touch of a button. No one site owns the content, but all sites benefit from the shared publicity. I am sure we could even work out a way to get around the <a title=\"SEO and Duplicate Content\" href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/learn-seo/duplicate-content\">SEO issue of duplicate content</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of all, I am hoping it would strengthen the web. Sites would be harder to censor and more resilient to attack. Knowledge would remain free and ideas can continue to be shared&hellip; and with the ability to register your own payloads you could invent crazy new ideas of your own.</p>\n<h3>But It Will Not Work!</h3>\n<p>I would love to hear why (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=@scottsweb%20(http://scott.ee/?p=861)\">you can reach me on twitter</a>). My background is as a designer and whilst I am a fairly proficient coder these days, I am far from a P2P or network expert.</p>\n<p>If you love the idea, I would like to hear from you too. I have created an <a title=\"WP2P on GitHub\" href=\"https://github.com/scottsweb/WP2P\">empty GitHub repository</a> and would welcome contributions, questions and everything in-between. If WP2P gets enough interest I may even seek to crowd fund the idea (but that is for another day).</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered if it would be possible to create a peer to peer (P2P) network using nothing but WordPress?

within the WordPress interface. Quick Sticky solves this problem.</p>\n<h3>One Sticky Post at a Time</h3>\n<p>On occasions I have also created sites where I have only wanted one sticky post at a time.

Since January I have attended <a title=\"New Adventures in Web Design Conference\" href=\"http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/\">New Adventures</a>, <a title=\"WordCamp Edinburgh\" href=\"http://2012.edinburgh.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a>, <a title=\"Reasons to be Creative\" href=\"http://www.reasonstobecreative.com/\">Reasons to be Creative</a>, <a title=\"Web Expo Guildford\" href=\"http://webexpoguildford.co.uk/\">Web Expo Guildford</a> and on Friday, <a title=\"Full Frontal Conference\" href=\"http://2012.full-frontal.org/\">Full Frontal</a>. I used to go to gigs&hellip; now it seems I go to conferences.</p>\n<p>Full Frontal is a one day JavaScript Conference run by <a title=\"Remy Sharp\" href=\"http://remysharp.com/about/\">Remy Sharp</a> that takes place in lovely Brighton. The venue for this years conference was the <a title=\"Duke of York Picture House on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Picture_House,_Brighton\">Duke of York&rsquo;s Picture House</a> and it has to be one of the nicest and comfiest venues I have been to. After an early start the comfy chairs and cosy lighting were just what I needed to settle in to a full day of talks.</p>\n<p>I believe it&rsquo;s the fourth year of the event but for me it was my first visit and I have to say a big thanks to <a title=\"Fellow Creative\" href=\"http://www.fellowcreative.com/\">Carl Jeffrey</a> for supplying the ticket. Carl is responsible for all of the beautifully designed moleskins, conference lanyards and branding.</p>\n<p>The underlying theme for the conference was an important one. Is JavaScript the future of the web or more specifically &ldquo;Does HTML &amp; semantics have a place in today&rsquo;s web apps?&rdquo;. The first two talks set out to tackle this question directly. The first came from <a title=\"James Pearce on twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jamespearce\">James Pearce</a> (developer relations, Facebook) with an argument that HTML is essentially nothing more than a few required tags that we can use to bootstrap a JavaScript application. JS can be used to apply styles, inject HTML and manipulate the DOM making HTML &amp; CSS rather redundant. His arguments were valid (especially when thinking about web applications) but it did raise a few concerns with me. I can&rsquo;t help but feel we have been in a similar place to this before and we have spent many long hard years advocating web standards and accessibility to now be on the verge of turning our backs on them once again.</p>\n<p>In the back of my mind I felt the next talk by&nbsp;<a title=\"John Allsopp\" href=\"https://twitter.com/johnallsopp\">John Allsopp</a> (developer and conference organiser for Web Directions) would offer a similar counter argument. Thankfully his argument was extremely refreshing. John discussed the trade off between simplicity and easiness and how we mess up three perfectly good, universal technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) for the sake of easiness and efficiency as web developers. He looked at issues of maintainability and leaned on his experiences as a software engineer to explain what makes the web&rsquo;s technology stack unique and worth protecting. There was very little to disagree with in John&rsquo;s talk but he was particularly hard on CSS preprocessors. This is a shame as I have learned to love <a title=\"LESS - Dynamic stylesheet language\" href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">LESS</a>. I do however see his point that this kind of abstraction adds unnecessary complexity and makes it harder for others to work on projects. Just last week I caught a young developer editing a cached CSS file generated from LESS. Unsurprisingly their hard work was overwritten very quickly.</p>\n<p>Random observation: I&rsquo;m not sure if it was deliberate or not but the slides from James and Johns talks were almost exact opposites of each other. James set his slides in white type with a black background with most of the text on the left of the screen. John&rsquo;s slides were the complete opposite (black text, white background set to the right of the screen).</p>\n<p>After the first break things became a little more hands on with a talk by <a title=\"Andrew Betts\" href=\"https://twitter.com/triblondon\">Andrew Betts</a> (Financial Times labs) on the <a title=\"App Cache for Beginners\" href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/\">HTML5 Application Cache</a> and <a title=\"Anna Debenham\" href=\"https://twitter.com/anna_debenham\">Anna Debenham</a> (font end web developer) on <a title=\"Console Browsers\" href=\"http://console.maban.co.uk/\">console browsers</a>. Both talks highlighted some interesting points but my ultimate takeaway was that app cache is a broken mess and consoles browsers are also a broken mess. For me this added weight to the fact that web standards are still very much all we have to rely on.</p>\n<p>The first talk of the afternoon was by <a title=\"Paul Kinlan\" href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_kinlan\">Paul Kinlan</a> (Chrome developer) looking at the future of browsers. <a title=\"Rebecca Murphey\" href=\"https://twitter.com/rmurphey\">Rebecca Murphey</a> (JavaScript developer at Bocoup) followed with a presentation on writing tests for JavaScript and after that was <a title=\"Steven Wittens\" href=\"https://twitter.com/unconed\">Steven Wittens</a> (JavaScript developer) on Making things with Maths. Steven&rsquo;s presentation was a piece of art in itself and I look forward to him <a title=\"Going Full Frontal - Steven Wittens\" href=\"http://acko.net/blog/going-full-frontal/\">sharing</a> his process of putting it together.</p>\n<p>The final talk for the day came from <a title=\"Chris Wilson\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cwilso\">Chirs Wilson</a> (Browser developer) sharing his experiences with developing browsers (from <a title=\"Mosaic Web Browser\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29\">Mosaic</a> to <a title=\"Internet Explorer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer\">IE</a> and now <a title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome\">Chrome</a>). There is a great deal to be learnt from our relatively short history on the web and with Chris having been around for most of it, he has some great stories to share.</p>\n<p>Full Frontal is certainly a niche conference with its single focus on JavaScript but as a result it facilitated a decent level of meaningful discussion. It was an excellent conference and I am left with many thoughts still to be pondered. See you all next year!?</p>\n<p>p.s. <del datetime=\"2013-02-04T17:16:17+00:00\">I will post a link to the conference videos once they become available.</del> <a title=\"Full Frontal 2012 videos on Lanyrd\" href=\"http://lanyrd.com/2012/full-frontal/video/\">The conference videos are now available</a>.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"It has been a busy year for me and conferences.
