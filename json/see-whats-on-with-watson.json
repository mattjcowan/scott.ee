For now we have to choose reliability over sustainability. All is not lost though, last month we purchased a very cool device called Watson, Watson is described as a &ldquo;Home (or Office) energy monitor&rdquo; and that is exactly what it does.</p>\n<p>It may look a little bit like a coffee table that glows pretty colours but Watson is an extremely useful and clever device that monitors (and logs to your PC or Mac) your energy usage. It&rsquo;s actually much smaller than it looks in the photo and has been sitting quietly in the office for last month recording our electricity usage. Before Watson we had no idea how much electricity we used or how much it was costing. The day it arrived we turned off every possible appliance we could get to and then slowly introduced each one, logging how much energy they use. By that evening we had already found two appliances that were consuming about 140W continuously (on standby) and that are now switched off at the wall when not in use. That alone should save us about &pound;170 a year!</p>\n<p>We now have an idea of how much electricity our local test server is consuming and which lights are best to turn on first. Each week we are looking at our logged data to see what days are the worst offenders and trying to figure what devices caused it&hellip; we are already up &pound;2 on last week!</p>\n<p>We may not have green hosting (yet) but the toggle office is no longer humming all day (and night).</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"It may look a little bit like a coffee table that glows pretty colours but Watson is an extremely useful and clever device that monitors (and logs to your PC or Mac) your energy usage.
