Instead it scrapes the publicly accessible JSON from the Instagram website.</p>\n<p>There is a increasing trend within the world of startups to lock your content away. Twitter taking away RSS is a good example of this and it&rsquo;s not something I agree with. Of course authentication should be required for certain features but making it harder to access my own content is not cool.</p>\n<p>In a short time the plugin has proved rather popular so it looks like folk are quite fond of this simple approach too. The popularity is such that I am considering using the same approach in a few more plugins.</p>\n<p>The widget has two filters. The first allows you adjust that cache time for retrieving the images from Instagram:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">add_filter('null_instagram_cache_time', 'my_cache_time');\r\nfunction my_cache_time() {\r\n    return HOUR_IN_SECONDS;\r\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The second allows you to filter video results from the widget:</p>\n<pre><code data-language=\"php\">add_filter('wpiw_images_only', '__return_true');</code></pre>\n<p>In version 1.3 I have also added two new hooks for adding custom output before and after the widget:</p>\n<pre><code>wpiw_before_widget\r\nwpiw_after_widget\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can contribute to the plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/cftp/wp-instagram-widget\">GitHub</a> or:</p>\n<p><a class=\"abutton btn btn--primary\" title=\"Download WP Instagram Widget from WordPress.org\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-instagram-widget/\">Download from WordPress.org</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"WP Instagram Widget is a simple plugin for WordPress that makes it easy to showcase your latest Instagram photos and videos on your website.","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[11],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1179"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=1179"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/1179/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=1179"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=1179"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=1179"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"author":[{"id":1,"name":"scottsweb","url":"","description":"","link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/author/scottsweb/","slug":"scottsweb","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/users"}]}}],"wp:term":[[{"id":11,"link":"https://api.scott.ee/journal/category/wordpress/","name":"WordPress","slug":"wordpress","taxonomy":"category","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/11"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/categories"}],"about":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/taxonomies/category"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https://api.scott.ee/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?categories=11"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}],[]]},"page":2}]
