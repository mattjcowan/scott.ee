I have been tinkering with the WordPress API to better understand what is involved with creating a decoupled theme. As with all good projects I started by setting myself a few goals:<ul><li><strong>Learn</strong>. I work with React most days so I wanted to try something else to better understand modern web development, not just a particular framework<li><strong>Speed</strong>. I wanted a site that is extremely fast, lightweight and better for the planet<li><strong>Resilient</strong>. A site can handle LOTS of traffic and is also available via the P2P web<li><strong>Low cost</strong>. Less than £15 a month to host and maintain<li><strong>Privacy built in</strong>.

Nuxt is a framework for creating Universal <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> Applications and in many ways it feels like working on a WordPress theme. It has a folder for your pages/templates, a hook API, support for plugins and components (or template parts if your thinking WordPress). Nuxt follows a philosophy of convention over configuration, drop Vue components in their respective folders and Nuxt will bind everything together.<p>This fairly rigid structure is important to the framework as it allows it to operate in three distinct modes:<ul><li>Single page application (SPA) – Run as a regular Vue web app<li>Server Side Rendered (SSR) – For each request, pre-render the application in a server and send that back to the client<li>Static (Generated) – Pre-render the application once during build, and then serve it as an SPA</ul><p>I was personally interested in the static (generated) and SPA modes which would allow me to host the interface in isolation to WordPress and without the need for Node.js hosting. This would allow me to make use of some of the free static hosting options out there like <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">GitHub pages</a> or <a href="https://href.li/?http://surge.sh/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">surge.sh</a>.<p>Out of the box Nuxt supports routing (<a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">vue router</a>), a store (<a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">vuex</a>), filters (core vue 2) and meta data (<a href="https://github.com/declandewet/vue-meta">vue-meta</a>). I added some additional plugins for progressive web app (<a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/pwa-module">PWA</a>) features, <a href="http://velocityjs.org/">animation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload">lazy loading</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Vivify-Ideas/vue-shortcuts">keyboard navigation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/sitemap-module">sitemap</a> generation and API consumption with <a href="https://axios.nuxtjs.org/">axios</a>.<p>After some experimentation I discovered that Nuxt didn’t quite work as I expected to. A statically generated version of the site only loads statically for the initial page load, the app is then bootstrapped and runs client side, making API requests back to the WordPress API. This is probably fine in most circumstances but I wanted to have a version of the site served over <a href="https://datproject.org/">Dat</a> (the <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">peer to peer web</a>) and would rather that it didn’t need the API. I was looking for a truly static site.<p>Luckily Nuxt has some hooks which allowed me to cache a local copy of the API responses as JSON during the build process. When deployed, the app will then query itself rather than the WordPress API. You can see some of the logic <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/modules/generate.js" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/plugins/axios.js" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">here</a>.<h3>WordPress</h3><p>The WordPress side didn’t need a great deal of tinkering. I moved the site to <a href="https://api.scott.ee">api.scott.ee</a> and set a redirect on that to the main site. I then introduced a couple of filters for supporting lazy loaded images and enabled <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/image-cdn/">photon in Jetpack</a> so images are served from a CDN. Images are the only thing that are not part of the generated build of the site.<p>WordPress should see very little traffic (if any) and only ever be hit when I want to write some new content or during the site build/generate process when the API is fetched and cached.<h3>Performance</h3><p>Nuxt takes care of a great deal of the app bundling, minification and optimisation for you. Add the PWA module and you can get a decent <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> score right out the box. I also recommend installing the <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/webpackmonitor-module">Nuxt webpack monitor module</a> which allows you to inspect the size of your bundles which can be useful when you start to make use of third party add ons. Running <code>yarn nuxt build --webpackmonitor --analyze</code> will launch an interactive breakdown of how your site is put together.<p>The next thing to implement was lazy loading. Lazy loading ensures that images are not wasting bandwidth by loading unnecessarily. Using Jetpack’s photon CDN I can request a much smaller version of the original image to act as a loading image while the original, full size image, is fetched.

Nuxt is a framework for creating Universal <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> Applications and in many ways it feels like working on a WordPress theme. It has a folder for your pages/templates, a hook API, support for plugins and components (or template parts if your thinking WordPress). Nuxt follows a philosophy of convention over configuration, drop Vue components in their respective folders and Nuxt will bind everything together.</p>\n<p>This fairly rigid structure is important to the framework as it allows it to operate in three distinct modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Single page application (SPA) &ndash; Run as a regular Vue web app</li>\n<li>Server Side Rendered (SSR) &ndash; For each request, pre-render the application in a server and send that back to the client</li>\n<li>Static (Generated) &ndash; Pre-render the application once during build, and then serve it as an SPA</li>\n</ul><p>I was personally interested in the static (generated) and SPA modes which would allow me to host the interface in isolation to WordPress and without the need for Node.js hosting. This would allow me to make use of some of the free static hosting options out there like&nbsp;<a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">GitHub pages</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?http://surge.sh/" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">surge.sh</a>.</p>\n<p>Out of the box Nuxt supports routing (<a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">vue router</a>), a store (<a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">vuex</a>), filters (core vue 2) and meta data (<a href="https://github.com/declandewet/vue-meta">vue-meta</a>). I added some additional plugins for progressive web app (<a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/pwa-module">PWA</a>) features, <a href="http://velocityjs.org/">animation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-lazyload">lazy loading</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Vivify-Ideas/vue-shortcuts">keyboard navigation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/sitemap-module">sitemap</a> generation and API consumption with <a href="https://axios.nuxtjs.org/">axios</a>.</p>\n<p>After some experimentation I discovered that Nuxt didn&rsquo;t quite work as I expected to. A statically generated version of the site only loads statically for the initial page load, the app is then bootstrapped and runs client side, making API requests back to the WordPress API. This is probably fine in most circumstances but I wanted to have a version of the site served over <a href="https://datproject.org/">Dat</a> (the <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">peer to peer web</a>) and would rather that it didn&rsquo;t need the API. I was looking for a truly static site.</p>\n<p>Luckily Nuxt has some hooks which allowed me to cache a local copy of the API responses as JSON during the build process. When deployed, the app will then query itself rather than the WordPress API. You can see some of the logic&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/modules/generate.js" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://github.com/scottsweb/scott.ee/blob/master/plugins/axios.js" rel="noreferrer noreferrer noreferrer">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>WordPress</h3>\n<p>The WordPress side didn&rsquo;t need a great deal of tinkering. I moved the site to <a href="https://api.scott.ee">api.scott.ee</a> and set a redirect on that to the main site. I then introduced a couple of filters for supporting lazy loaded images and enabled <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/image-cdn/">photon in Jetpack</a> so images are served from a CDN. Images are the only thing that are not part of the generated build of the site.</p>\n<p>WordPress should see very little traffic (if any) and only ever be hit when I want to write some new content or during the site build/generate process when the API is fetched and cached.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Nuxt takes care of a great deal of the app bundling, minification and optimisation for you. Add the PWA module and you can get a decent <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> score right out the box. I also recommend installing the <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/webpackmonitor-module">Nuxt webpack monitor module</a> which allows you to inspect the size of your bundles which can be useful when you start to make use of third party add ons. Running <code>yarn nuxt build --webpackmonitor --analyze</code> will launch an interactive breakdown of how your site is put together.</p>\n<p>The next thing to implement was lazy loading. Lazy loading ensures that images are not wasting bandwidth by loading unnecessarily. Using Jetpack&rsquo;s photon CDN I can request a much smaller version of the original image to act as a loading image while the original, full size image, is fetched. I use CSS filters to blur the loading image slightly and make it greyscale. The result is rather neat:</p>\n<p><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1597" src="https://i1.wp.com/api.scott.ee/wp-content/uploads/journal-hampshire-river.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image of river in Hampshire, England.
