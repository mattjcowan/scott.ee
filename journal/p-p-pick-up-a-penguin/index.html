It is an impressive bit of kit. Small, light, well built and very comfortable to use. There are some really nice little touches. For example there is an option in the BIOS to turn it into a battery pack for other USB devices and I really appreciated that the laptop shipped in packaging that is almost completely recyclable.<p>My main complaint would be the placement of the webcam which sits just above the keyboard and makes for some interesting perspectives on video calls. The webcam placement though allows for an almost borderless display which is probably one of the nicest parts of the laptop. In short, it is a compromise worth making.<p>I have improved the webcam problem by bringing the laptop off of the desk on a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/" target="_blank">Roost stand</a>. The stand is portable too so I intend to take it with me when travelling.<p>I have been impressed at how well devices have worked with this laptop. For instance I can easily switch between HDMI audio, internal audio and headphones. This all works far better than it ever did on my Mac.<h3>The OS</h3><p><noscript><img alt="A screenshot of a customised Ubuntu install that is running the Cinnamon desktop.

It is an impressive bit of kit. Small, light, well built and very comfortable to use. There are some really nice little touches. For example there is an option in the BIOS to turn it into a battery pack for other USB devices and I really appreciated that the laptop shipped in packaging that is almost completely recyclable.</p>\n<p>My main complaint would be the placement of the webcam which sits just above the keyboard and makes for some interesting perspectives on video calls. The webcam placement though allows for an almost borderless display which is probably one of the nicest parts of the laptop. In short, it is a compromise worth making.</p>\n<p>I have improved the webcam problem by bringing the laptop off of the desk on a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/" target="_blank">Roost stand</a>. The stand is portable too so I intend to take it with me when travelling.</p>\n<p>I have been impressed at how well devices have worked with this laptop. For instance I can easily switch between HDMI audio, internal audio and headphones. This all works far better than it ever did on my Mac.</p>\n<h3>The OS</h3>\n<p><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-239" src="https://i2.wp.com/scottsweb.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/screenshot-from-2017-03-31-14-34-23.png?resize=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a customised Ubuntu install that is running the Cinnamon desktop.
